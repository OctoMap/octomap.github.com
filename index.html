      <section>
        <p>The OctoMap library
implements a 3D occupancy grid mapping
approach, providing data structures and mapping algorithms in C++. The map
implementation is based on an octree and is designed to meet the following
requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Full 3D model.</strong>  The map is able to model arbitrary environments
without prior assumptions about it. The representation models occupied
areas as well as free space. If no information is available about an
area (commonly denoted as <i>unknown areas</i>), this information is
encoded as well.  While the distinction between free and occupied
space is essential for safe robot navigation, information about
unknown areas is important, e.g., for autonomous exploration of an
environment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Updatable.</strong>  It is possible to add new information or sensor
readings at any time. Modeling and updating is done in
a <i>probabilistic</i> fashion. This accounts for sensor noise or
measurements which result from dynamic changes in the environment,
e.g., because of dynamic objects.  Furthermore, multiple robots are
able to contribute to the same map and a previously recorded map is
extendable when new areas are explored.</li>
<li>
<strong>Flexible.</strong> The extent of the map does not have to be known in
advance. Instead, the map is dynamically expanded as needed. The map
is multi-resolution so that, for instance, a high-level planner is
able to use a coarse map, while a local planner may operate using a
fine resolution. This also allows for efficient visualizations which
scale from coarse overviews to detailed close-up views.</li>
<li>
<strong>Compact.</strong> The map is stored efficiently, both in memory and on
disk. It is possible to generate compressed files for later usage or
convenient exchange between robots even under bandwidth constraints.</li>
</ul><p>Detailed information about the implemented approach can be found in the<a href="http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/papers/wurm10octomap.pdf">OctoMap paper (PDF)</a>. </p>

<p>The OctoMap library is available as a self-contained source distribution for Linux (recommended), Mac OS and Windows. It was developed by <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/%7Ewurm/">Kai M. Wurm</a> and <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/%7Ehornunga/">Armin Hornung</a>, and is currently maintained by Armin Hornung (<a href="https://github.com/ahornung" class="user-mention">@ahornung</a>). Feel free to contact us with questions and issues. To report bugs or request features, best use our tracker at <a href="https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap/issues">https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap/issues</a>. We would like to thank Stefan Oßwald, Jörg Müller, Radu Rusu, Raphael Schmitt, and Christoph Sprunk for their contrbutions. </p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Download</h3>

<h3>Compilation</h3>

<h2>Maps</h2>

<p>Take a look at some of our example maps below. You can find these and more datasets in our <a href="http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/projects/datasets/octomap/">dataset repository</a> as finished OctoMap files and sources in the form of 3D laser scans. </p>

<h2>Importing Data</h2>

<h3>Laser Scan Data</h3>

<p>Plain-text laser scan data can be imported from the following file format:</p>

<pre><code>NODE x y z roll pitch yaw
x y z
x y z
[...]
NODE x y z roll pitch yaw
x y z
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>The keyword NODE is followed by the 6D pose of the laser origin of the 3D scan (roll, pitch, and yaw angles are around the axes x, y, z respectively). After a NODE-line, the laser endpoints of the scan originating at that scan node are listed as 3D points, in the coordinate frame of the scan node. The next NODE keyword specifies the start of a new 3D scan. Lines starting with '#' or empty lines are ignored.</p>

<p>Our tool "log2graph" converts these plain-text log files into a binary scan graph file, which can be directly opened and converted in the viewer "octovis", or converted to an octree map from the command line with "graph2tree".</p>

<h3>3D model files</h3>

<p>You can directly create an OctoMap file from a variety of 3D file formats (3DS, VRML, OBJ ...) by first voxelizing them with <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Emin/binvox">binvox</a>. For convenience, we provide the binvox Linux binary in src/extern/binvox.</p>

<p>After converting your 3D data to a binvox file, you can create an Octree map from it by running our tool "binvox2bt". </p>
